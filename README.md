# 🧠 cassidoo-weekly-quizzes

A collection of my solutions to the weekly coding puzzles shared by [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/). Each folder in this repo corresponds to a week's quiz, with a brief description, my approach, and the solution code.

## ✨ What is this?

Cassidoo shares a fun and clever coding question every week in her newsletter. This repo is my personal attempt to solve them — to keep learning, stay sharp, and enjoy the little brain bends.

Each week's folder includes:
- `README.md`: The question prompt + explanation of my approach.
- `solution.*`: The actual solution (usually in JavaScript, unless stated otherwise).

## ✅ Goals

- Practice problem-solving weekly.
- Document approaches and learnings.
- Track growth over time.
- Maybe help someone else stuck on the same puzzle.
