#This week's question:
```
Given an array arr representing the positions of monsters along a straight line, 
and an integer d representing the minimum safe distance required between any two monsters, 
write a function to determine if all monsters are at least d units apart. 
If not, return the smallest distance found between any two monsters. If all monsters are safely spaced, return -1.

Examples:

let monsters = [3, 8, 10, 15];
let d = 6;
minMonsterDistance(bees, d)
> 2

minMonsterDistance([5, 9, 14, 18], 4)
> -1
```
